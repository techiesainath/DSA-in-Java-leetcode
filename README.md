DSA Practice in Java:
This repository contains a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems I have solved using Java programming language.

Introduction

This project is aimed at improving my skills in DSA using Java. In this project, I have practiced various DSA concepts such as sorting, searching, graph traversal, dynamic programming, and more. Each problem solution is accompanied by a detailed explanation of the problem statement, the approach I used to solve it, and the code I wrote to implement my solution.

DSA is an essential tool for software development. It allows you to efficiently store and manipulate data, and to solve complex problems quickly and accurately. By practicing DSA in Java, I am developing a skill set that will help me create efficient and effective software.

To use this repository, you can clone or download the code to your local machine. Each problem solution is contained in a separate Java file, named after the problem. In the file, you will find the problem statement, my approach to solving it, and the code implementation. You can run the code in your preferred Java IDE to test it.

Contribution

I welcome contributions from anyone who is interested in contributing to this repository. If you have a new problem solution to add or want to suggest improvements to an existing one, please feel free to create a pull request.
